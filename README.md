# agwe-recipe

This recipe trains acoustic and written word embeddings on paired data
consisting of word labels and spoken word segments.

The training objective is based on the multiview triplet loss functions
of [Wanjia et al., 2016](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1611.04496.pdf).
Hard negative sampling was added in [Settle et al., 2019](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1903.12306.pdf) to improve
training speed (similar to `src/multiview_triplet_loss_old.py`), and while the current version (see `src/multiview_triplet_loss.py`) uses semi-hard negative sampling [Schroff et al.](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1503.03832.pdf) as well as `obj1` from Wanjia et al.
(similar to `src/multiview_triplet_loss_old.py`).

### Dependencies
python 3, pytorch 1.4, h5py, numpy, scipy

### Training

Edit `train_config.json` and run `train.sh`
```
./train.sh
```

### Evaluate
Edit `eval_config.json` and run `eval.sh`

### Results
With the default train_config.json you should obtain the following results:

acoustic_ap= 0.79

crossview_ap= 0.75
